## üöÄ How to Get Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before diving into the application, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Python-docx**: For processing DOCX files.
- **Transformers**: For NLP models.
- **Torch**: For running the models.
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning capabilities.
- **Python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **PSUtil**: For monitoring system resources.

You can easily install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas python-docx transformers torch tensorflow python-dotenv psutil
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Environment Variables on Windows

#### Paths to Add
To ensure everything runs smoothly, you‚Äôll need to add the following paths to your environment variables:

1. **Python Installation Path**: 
   ```
   C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\
   ```
   
2. **Scripts Folder Path**: 
   ```
   C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\
   ```

#### Steps to Add to PATH
1. **Open Environment Variables**:
   - Right-click on **This PC** or **My Computer** on your desktop or in File Explorer, and choose **Properties**.
   - Click on **Advanced system settings**.
   - In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.

2. **Edit the PATH Variable**:
   - In the **Environment Variables** window, scroll under **System variables** to find **Path**. Select it and click **Edit**.
   - In the **Edit Environment Variables** window, click **New** and add:
     - `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\`
     - `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\`

3. **Save and Restart**:
   - Click **OK** to close all dialog boxes.
   - Restart your terminal or PowerShell to apply the changes.

### üíª Running the Application
To launch the summarization tool, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The **News Article Summarizer** operates by allowing users to input text directly or upload files (CSV, TXT, or DOCX) containing articles. The application intelligently processes the input using a sophisticated summarization model, providing concise summaries that are easy to digest. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Options**: Users can either paste text or upload a file for summarization.
2. **Text Processing**: The application analyzes the input and applies the summarization model.
3. **Output Generation**: The concise summary is displayed along with additional details, such as the author's name and word count.

### üîç Under the Hood
The summarization process utilizes an advanced model from Hugging Face, allowing for both **Extractive** and **Abstractive** summarization techniques. The model is fine-tuned to understand context and generate coherent summaries that maintain the original meaning of the text. This ensures that users receive concise yet informative outputs.
